## Overview

healthyr is an R package for distributing UK health data:

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/healthyr")
```

## Development

To add data sets to the package:

1. Update `data-raw/query-urls.R`. Keep to alphabetical ordering.
Make sure to build and export the tibble.
2. Add a file to `data-raw/`. See other files for template.
3. Document the data set in `R/data.R`. Keep to alphabetical ordering.
4. Run `devtools::document()` to export documentation.
5. Run `devtools::check()` to check for errors/warnings/notes.
6. Update `LICENSE` by adding the license of the new data set if not already
covered.
